# Fix Forced Logout on Page Reload

## Issue
User reports that the app forces logout on every page reload, even when logged in.

## Root Cause
The AuthContext checks authentication on app load by calling getUserApi. If the API call fails for any reason (network issues, server errors, etc.), the token is removed from localStorage, causing logout.

## Solution Implemented
Modified `auth.context.jsx` to only remove the access token on explicit 401 Unauthorized errors or token-related messages. For other errors (e.g., network issues, server downtime), the token is preserved, preventing forced logout.

## Changes Made
- Updated `ReactJS01/reactjs01/src/components/context/auth.context.jsx`:
  - In the `checkAuth` function, added conditional logic to only remove token on 401 status or token invalid messages.
  - For other errors, set authentication to false but keep the token in localStorage.

## Followup Steps
- Test the app by logging in and reloading the page.
- If token expiration is still an issue, consider increasing JWT_EXPIRE in backend .env file.
- Optionally, implement token refresh mechanism for better UX.
